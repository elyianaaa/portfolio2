                        This is a poster design inspired by a new album called <em>"Walk."</em> by NCT 127. The design captures the laidback vibes of the album, blending the most used colors in the album teasers using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

                        The concept behind this design was to experiment and have fun with the teasers released for the member. The phrase "Walking Club" was inspired by the album’s title "Walk" and also got inspired by an album namecard inclusion.
