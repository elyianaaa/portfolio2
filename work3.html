                        This is a poster design inspired by a new album called <em>"Walk."</em> by NCT 127. The design captures the laidback vibes of the album, blending the most used colors in the album teasers using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Tools & Apps Used</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> – Mainly for picture layout and text arrangement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> – Used extensively for text style manipulation, such as warping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pinterest</strong> – For finding texture overlays to enhance the design's feel.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p class="concept">
                        The concept behind this design was to experiment and have fun with the teasers released for the member Mark. The goal was to capture the overall vibe of the album. The phrase "Walking Club" was inspired by the album’s title "Walk" and also influenced by the member's namecard called "Walking Club."
                    </p>

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>The process started with research, gathering inspiration from various design sources and the album teasers. After establishing a concept, I moved on to creating the layout using Adobe Photoshop, experimenting with color palettes and typography to match the album's theme. The design was refined with feedback and finalized by adding textures and text effects in Illustrator to give it a polished look.</p>
