                    <p>This is a responsive website for a Pizza shop, featuring a pizza name search filter and dynamic opening/closing timing based on the system time. The site adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices.</p>

                    <h2>Tools & Apps Used</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> – Used for writing all the code for the website.</li>
                        <li><strong>React</strong> – Framework used to build the dynamic components and manage state.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>The concept of the website revolves around user interaction, allowing users to filter pizza names based on their preferences. Additionally, the dynamic "open/close" sign adjusts based on real-time data, showing if the pizza shop is currently open or closed. This creates a more engaging and functional experience for users.</p>

                    <h2>Development Process</h2>
                    <p>The project started with wireframing and planning the user interface. After selecting the layout, I used React to build the dynamic features, including the pizza search filter and real-time opening/closing status. The design was enhanced with images and graphics made in Photoshop and Illustrator, and I ensured responsiveness across devices for optimal user experience.</p>
