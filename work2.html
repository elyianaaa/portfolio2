                    <p>This is a poster design inspired by the song <em>"Metamodernity."</em> The design captures the song's mood, blending vibrant colors and modern typography using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. The design evokes emotions of love, nostalgia, and the juxtaposition between light and dark tones.</p>

                    <h2>Design Concept</h2>
                    <p>The concept behind this design is to evoke a sense of nostalgia and love through the use of contrasting elements. The typography was carefully placed to create a dynamic, modern look that complements the emotions evoked by the song.</p>

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>The project began with brainstorming and sketching, followed by the selection of a color palette that reflects the song’s energy. The final design was brought to life using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, where I focused on typography, balance, and color to visually represent the themes of the song.</p>
