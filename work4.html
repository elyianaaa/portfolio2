                    <p>This is a high fidelity design project for a Style Shop, focusing on creating a polished user interface. The design combines clean typography, a user-friendly layout, and an intuitive navigation system, ensuring a top-tier user experience.</p>

                    <h2>Tools & Apps Used</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Figma</strong> – A powerful tool for designing web and mobile interfaces, perfect for collaboration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Behance</strong> – A platform for gathering inspiration and exploring design trends to inform the project.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>The concept behind this design was to create a clean, modern, and functional interface for the Style Shop application. The goal was to enhance user experience by prioritizing simplicity, ensuring that users can navigate the app with ease and enjoy the design's polished aesthetics.</p>

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>The process began with research and creating wireframes to outline the basic structure. I then moved to Figma to develop the high-fidelity design, paying special attention to the details such as color scheme, typography, and responsive elements. User testing played a key role in refining the interface to meet usability goals.</p>
